# PyTorch Lightning Hello World

This repo contains a minimal model for MNIST with implementations of a dataloader, training and evaluation using PyTorch lightning logic.

Great part of the implementation is not original and was made by [@aladdinpersson](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection).
